# Utah-MSTAT-LaTeX-Work

## LaTeX Work for the following MSTAT Courses:
* Math 5075
* Math 5080
* Math 5600
* Stat 6969

## Introduction
I am enrolled in the MSTAT program at the University of Utah as of Spring 2021.  I was encouraged to use LaTeX as a way to write my math work.  I am so happy to have taken the advice and learned the code.  My work looks professional and effective.  I receive compliments from professors, as well as good grades.   I am so happy with the results!

### Purpose and desires...
My goal in learning LaTeX is to professionally create pdf documents that are easy to follow with appropriate math language and annotations.  The purpose of this repository, is to keep track of all the LaTeX work that I perform in my MSTAT program.  I expect to have weekly assignments in most classes.  

For Spring 2021 courses, Math 5075 and Math 5080, I have weekly assignments.  In Math 5600, I have four total homework assignments.  Stat 6969 has weekly assignments, but I will not be using LaTeX for all of them.
